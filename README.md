App aims to helps students to learn about converting DNA to mRNA(or vice versa) and mRNA to protein in biology A-Levels easily
StudyMate App
The StudyMate App is designed to help students learn about the process of converting DNA to mRNA (or vice versa) and mRNA to protein in biology A-Levels. The app provides an intuitive interface for entering DNA or mRNA sequences and obtaining the corresponding translations.

Features
Input fields for DNA, mRNA, and protein sequences
Conversion functionality to translate DNA to mRNA and mRNA to protein
Example text to guide users on sequence format
Error handling for incorrect input or multiple sequence inputs
Integration with an organization's website for additional resources
Installation and Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using the following command:
pip install PyQt5
Run the application using the following command:
python main.py
The StudyMate App window will appear, allowing you to enter DNA or mRNA sequences and convert them to the corresponding translations.
Fill in either the DNA or mRNA input field with uppercase letters. Only one field should be filled to obtain a result.
The converted translation will be displayed in the protein input field.
If an error occurs or multiple sequences are entered, an error dialog will be shown with a descriptive message.

Organization Website
The StudyMate App provides a menu option to visit the organization's website. Clicking on "Our Organization" in the menu bar and selecting "Visit Website" will open the organization's website in your default web browser.
